5. **Mark all paid** bulk operation
6. **1000-step amount inputs** for better UX
7. **Comprehensive localStorage** integration
8. **Optimized development** environment
9. **Complete test coverage** following TDD principles

## 🔄 TDD Implementation Approach

Every task followed the strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **🔴 RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **🟢 GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass tests
3. **🔵 REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **✅ VERIFY**: Run full test suite and manual testing

## 📊 Final Quality Gates

All quality gates have been met:

- ✅ All tests passing (13 calculation tests + 22 component tests)
- ✅ No linting errors (ESLint + Prettier)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ Manual testing completed
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Performance optimized

## 🚀 Ready for Production
